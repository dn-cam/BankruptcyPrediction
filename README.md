# BankruptcyPrediction
## Bankruptcy Prediction on Polish Companies Dataset 

The financial health of any company is reflected in its revenue, net and gross profits, liabilities and various other econometric measures. Those measures, in turn, can be used to make judgments regarding how the company is performing in the market, and also how they might perform in the future. This project analyses the results for Bankruptcy Prediction for Polish Companies in the emerging markets. The dataset being highly imbalanced (minority class less than 6% of the dataset), Synthetic Minority Oversamplng Technique (SMOTE) was used to resolve the class imbalance issue. The predictions were based on 64 econometric ratios published by those companies, and various supervised machine learning classification models were compared for this task, starting from the simple Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes to the more complex Neural Network. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis gave the best performance when it came to predicting, with the highest F1 scores.
